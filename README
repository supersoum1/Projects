My task was to design and implement a 2D tile-based world exploration engine. By "tile-based," it meant that the worlds I crafted consisted 
of a 2D grid of tiles, establishing a methodical yet adaptable framework for world design. The "world exploration engine" aspect of this
endeavour required me to develop a world that users could navigate, allowing for exploration and interaction with various objects within this
world, all from an overhead perspective.

This project was an exhilarating challenge that married game design elements with the nuances of software engineering. I was tasked with
contemplating both the technical execution of the tile-based system and the user experience of exploration and interaction. Although the 
complexity of my project did not rival that of highly sophisticated systems like the NES game "Zelda II"—which served as an inspirational
example—it was an engaging opportunity to dive into the mechanics of world-building and interactive design. My objective was to create a
compelling and immersive environment that captured the spirit of exploration and adventure, albeit on a more modest scale.
